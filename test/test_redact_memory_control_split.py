"""Control characters must not carry credential material past the memory scrubber.

Both redactors behind ``_redact_memory_field`` decide by matching a pattern against
text. A control character embedded mid-token splits the token, so the pattern cannot
match and the field leaves on an egress path still carrying the credential -- broken
for a consumer that renders it verbatim, whole again for any consumer that drops
control bytes. Separators are spelled as explicit ``bytes`` here so the case under
test is the byte sequence rather than an editor's rendering of it.
